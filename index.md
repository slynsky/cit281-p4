## Project Purpose and Components
More server-side practice was the main objective of project 4, which asked students to use fastify, postman, and code modules to create and test dynamic outputs.

## What I Learned
This project really helped me learn to combine skills I had been learning throughout the term. It was really satisfying to complete, and forced me to excercise my creative problem solving skills.
